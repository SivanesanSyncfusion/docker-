## Run single container `Bold BI` via `docker-compose`

 This quick-start guide demonstrates how to use Compose to set up and run Bold BI. Before starting, make sure you have installed [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Define the Project

  1. Create an empty project directory.<br/>
  You can name the directory something easy for you to remember. This directory is the context for your application image.<br/>
  This project directory should contains a `docker-compose.yml` file which is complete in itself for a good starter BoldBI project.
  
  2. Download the configuration files [here](/deploy/single-container/). This directory includes docker-compose YML file and configuration file for Nginx.

      > **Tip:**
        You can use either a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension for this file. They both works well.
      
  3.  Change into your project directory.
  For example, if you named your directory `my_boldbi`

      ```sh
      $  cd my_boldbi/
      ```

  4. Create a docker-compose.yml file that starts your `BoldBI`  and a separate `PostgreSQL` instance with volume mounts for data persistence:

```sh
version: '3.5'

services:
  boldbi:
   image: syncfusion/boldbi
   restart: always
   ports:
     - 8085:80
   # environment:
     # - APP_URL=<app_base_url>
   networks:
     - boldbi
   volumes:
     - boldbi_data:/application/app_data
    
  pgdb:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: <Password>
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    networks:
      - boldbi

networks:
  boldbi:
  
volumes:
  boldbi_data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: 'none'
      o: 'bind'
      device: '<host_path_boldbi_data>'
  db_data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: 'none'
      o: 'bind'
      device: '<host_path_db_data>'
  ```
  5. Replace `<app_base_url>` with your DNS or IP address, by which you want to access the application.
    
      For example, <br/>
          `http://example.com` <br/>
          `https://example.com` <br/>
          `http://<public_ip_address>` <br/>

      > **Note:**
      > * If you are using the IP address for the Base URL, make sure you are using the public IP of the machine instead of internal IP or local IP address. Applications can communicate with each other using the public IP alone. Host machine IP will not be accessible inside the application container.
      > * Provide the HTTP or HTTPS scheme for APP_BASE_URL value.

  6. You can also change the Port number other than `8085`

  7. Allocate a directory in your host machine to store the shared folders for applicationsâ€™ usage. Replace the directory path with `<host_path_boldbi_data>` and `<host_path_db_data>` in **docker-compose.yml** file.

       For example, <br><b>Windows:</b> `device: 'D:/boldbi/boldbi_data'` and `device: 'D:/boldbi/db_data'` <br><b>Linux:</b> `device: '/var/boldbi/boldbi_data'` and `device: '/var/boldbi/db_data'`

      > **Note:**
      > The docker volumes `boldbi_data` and `db_data` persists data of Bold BI and PostgreSQL respectively. [Learn more about docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)

### Build the project

Now, run `docker-compose up -d` from your project directory.
<br />

This runs `docker-compose up` in detached mode, pulls the needed Docker images, and starts the boldbi and database containers, as shown in the example below.
```sh
docker-compose up -d

Creating network "my_boldbi_boldbi" with the default driver
Creating volume "my_boldbi_boldbi_data" with local driver
Creating volume "my_boldbi_db_data" with local driver
Pulling db (postgres:)...
latest: Pulling from library/postgres
7d63c13d9b9b: Pull complete
cad0f9d5f5fe: Pull complete
<...>
Digest:sha256:db927beee892dd02fbe963559f29a7867708747934812a80f83bff406a0d54fd
Status: Downloaded newer image for postgres:latest
Creating my_boldbi_boldbi_1 ... done
Creating my_boldbi_db_1     ... done
```
### Bring up Bold BI in a web browser

At this point, Bold BI should be running in `<app_base_url>:8085` (as appropriate)

> **Note:**
> The BoldBI site is not immediately available on port 8085 because the containers are still being initialized and may take a couple of minutes for the first load.

### Application Startup

Configure the Bold BI On-Premise application startup to use the application. Please refer the following link for more details on configuring the application startup.

https://help.boldbi.com/embedded-bi/application-startup

> **Note:**
> To use the above configured PostgreSQL server in Bold BI please use `pgdb` as the PostgreSQL server name.

### Shutdown and cleanup

The command `docker-compose down` removes the containers and default network, but preserves the volumes of Bold BI and PostgreSQL. <br /><br />
The command `docker-compose down --volumes` removes the containers, default network, and all the volumes.
